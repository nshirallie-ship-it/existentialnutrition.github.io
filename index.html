<h2>Nutrition got you feeling existential?</h2>
<p>Well, welome to health! Because without health...there's nothing! I'm Nicole and I'm here to help you with your nutrition questions and other inqueries.
Existential Nutrition is perfect for you if you:

<li>or just need/want support for health and nutrition woes!</li>
</ul>
 </p>
 <h2>What can you expect at Existential Nutrition?</h2>
 <p>Besides some existential dread, you can expect a lighthearted, casual tone! I believe that attitude can chage a lot, so I emphasize humor when I can. This website isn't soley about nutrition, although it is my focus. I want to enourage everyone to do the best they can with where they are now. There's no such thing as perfection, and isn't that boring anyway? But I believe that your life, begins with your health, and feeling as healthy, confidant, and amazing as you can! This is where I ome in, if you've been struggling with putting together meals that fit your nutrition requirements as well as your time constraints, feeling good in your body with chronic disease, struggling to accept your body, or just need some accountability and support, I'm your girl! Just head over to the nutrition page for more info, or go straight to connect to contact me with your inquuries and how I might be of help to you!</p>

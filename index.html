<div id="home"><h2>Nutrition got you feeling existential?</h2>
<p>Well, welome to health! Because without health...there's nothing! After staring into the void (aka the mirror) a little too long, I decided to join the real world in search for answers. There I found the power of choice, and the foundation of nutrition. Our bodies are incredible, resilient, but there's sooo much that can go wrong (unfortunately). I find that when I feel healthy, I feel better prepared to take on whatever life has to offer. And while I'm here...might as well make the most of it! 
Existential Nutrition is perfect for you if you:
<ul>
<li>need help regulating blood sugar</li>
<li>need help meal planning</li>
<li>need help managing chronic illness through diet</li>
<li>or just need/want support for health and nutrition woes!</li>
</ul>
 </p>
 <h2>What can you expect at Existential Nutrition?</h2>
 <p>Besides some existential dread, you can expect a lighthearted, casual tone! I believe that attitude can chage a lot, so I emphasize humor when I can. Existential Nutrition isn't soley about nutrition, although it is my focus. I want to enourage everyone to do the best they can with where they are now. My focus is on creating healthy, sustainable habits. There's no such thing as perfection, and isn't that boring anyway? But I believe that your life, begins with your health, and feeling as healthy, confidant, and amazing as you can! This is where I can help:<br>
<ol>
<li> if you've been struggling with putting together meals that fit your nutrition requirements as well as your time constraints</li>
<li> feeling healthy in your body with chronic disease</li>
<li> struggling to accept your body</li>
<li> or just need some accountability and support</li>
</ol>
 ...I'm here for your nutritional inqueries and support!</p> </div>
<div id="nutrition"><h2>My Diet Philosophy</h2>
<p>Well, besides feeling existential about it that is....<br>I believe in an individualistic approach to nutrition, so what works for me, may not be the best fit for you! And that's ok. Every body is different, and it's embracing these differences that can help clarify what could be the missing piece in your personal nutrition puzzle. I believe on focusing on unprocessed foods as much as possible, while still enjoying convenience when desired. One thing I enjoy about existentialism (and why it's so relevant to my personal philosophy) is that it conveys the importance of personal choice and responsilbilty. Ultimately, we choose how we live our lives, including our diets! But sometimes we need a little help...(right?)<br>With that, I'm happy to be a part of your journey in figuring out how best to achieve your health goals...for the health of it!</p>
<h2>How I can help:</h2>
<p>In the spirit of autheticity, here's some of the health issues I have personally struggled with and helped myself with diet:</p>
<ul>
<li>type 1 diabetes</li>
<li>celiac</li>
<li>weight issues/disordered eating</li>
<li>bloating/digestive issues</li>
<li>skin issues</li>
<li>mood issues</li>
</ul>
<p>...a lot of these 'issues' are chronic in that there is no cure. But I am absolutlely grateful for the role proper nutrition has had in helping me manage these health woes as well as improving my quality of life. If you would like help in modifying your diet to help alleviate/manage chronic health issues, please shoot me an email (in the link to the right) and tell me:</p>
<ol>
 <li>who you are</li>
 <li>what your nutrition/health goals are</li>
<li> a food diary of at least a day or a week so that I can help figure out where we can tinker with your diet :)</li>
</ol>
 <p>I LOVE simplicity and I also would like to make this service as accessible as possible so each consultation is $30!<br>

<figcaption>Hi! I'm Nicole. And there's my cat, Charlotte, too! I've always been passionate about health and wellness, and recently graduated with my bachelor's in Applied Nutrition and Health. I have type 1 diabetes and celiac so the existential crisis surrounding nutrition is deep for me. I have spent too much time feeling unhealthy and uninspired given my dietary restrictions and want to help others who may be struggling with the same thing, which is why I created this website.</figcaption>

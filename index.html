<div id="home"><h2>Nutrition got you feeling existential?</h2>
<p>Well, welcome to health! Because without health...there's nothing! After staring into the void (aka the mirror) a little too long, I decided to join the real world in search of answers. There I found the power of choice, and the foundation of nutrition. Our bodies are incredible, resilient, but there's sooo much that can go wrong (unfortunately). I find that when I feel healthy, I feel better prepared to take on whatever life has to offer. And while I'm here...might as well make the most of it! But before all that…<br>
Nutrition consumed me. It was kind of my whole world. First with type 1 diabetes at 16, then with celiac a few years later, I felt like I couldn’t catch a break. Why was my body hellbent on destroying me? I struggled to find balance, but it only left me feeling disillusioned.<br>
 So, I got my degree in Nutrition to try and sort the puzzle out for myself, thinking that if life was going to force me to be obsessed with food anyway, I might as well put it to use. I liked the idea of becoming an RD and using not only my personal experience, but my education as well to help people who may be struggling like I did. Unfortunately, it turns out I hate working with numbers, and my great idea of working in nutrition suddenly didn’t seem so appealing any longer …leaving me in my existential state as I am now…<br>
</p>
 <h2>So, what can you expect at Existential Nutrition?</h2>
 <p>Besides some existential dread that is, you can still expect a lot of nutrition talk, just probably more opinion based, and then sprinkled in with some other random existential thoughts. I do still really value nutrition as a foundation for getting me to where I am today, and as someone who greatly struggled in the past, I still want to create a space for others who may be dealing with chronic illnesses in this fast-paced world we live in. I want to encourage everyone to do the best they can with where they are now. My focus is on creating healthy, sustainable habits since those are more likely to create a lifestyle you can stick to. I believe that your life begins with your health, because truly what’s hotter than health? <br>
</p> </div>
<div id="nutrition"><h2>My Diet Philosophy</h2>
<p>Well, besides feeling existential about it that is....<br>
I believe in an individualistic approach to nutrition, so what works for me may not be the best fit for you! And that's ok. Every body is different, and it's embracing these differences that can help clarify what could be the missing piece in your personal nutrition puzzle. I believe in focusing on unprocessed foods as much as possible, while still enjoying convenience from time to time (when it’s convenient-haha). I also LOVE simplicity (Occam’s razor) so whatever is simpler, I’ll take it. One thing I enjoy about existentialism (and why it's so relevant to my personal philosophy) is that it conveys the importance of personal choice and responsibility. Ultimately, we choose how we live our lives, including our diets! But sometimes we need a little help...(right?)
</p>
<h2>How I can help:</h2>
<p>If you've ever found yourself asking any of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"What do I even eat?"</li>
<li>"How do I navigate eating out?"</li>
<li>"How can I sustainably lose weight?"</li>
<li>“Why am I bloated/have skin issues/other recurring symptoms?”</li>
<li>"Why do I feel like, *not well* all the time?"</li>
<li>"What does this mean for my cancer sun and pieces moon?!"</li>
</ul>
<p>...then you’re not alone, because I’ve literally asked myself these same questions possibly multiple times, possibly into the void and coming up with nothing. But now, I have a little more than nothing, so I am excited to create a space for questions and (hopefully) answers. Shoot me an email or just stay for the company! :) </p>

<figcaption>Hi! I'm Nicole. And there's my cat, Charlotte, too! I've always been passionate about health and wellness, and recently graduated with my Bachelor's in Applied Nutrition and Health. I have type 1 diabetes and celiac so the existential crisis surrounding nutrition is deep for me. I have spent too much time feeling unhealthy and uninspired given my dietary restrictions and want to help others who may be struggling with the same thing, which is why I created this website.</figcaption>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Nicole. And there's my cat, Charlotte, too! I've always been passionate about health and wellness, and recently graduated with my bachelor's in Applied Nutrition and Health. I have type 1 diabetes and celiac so the existential crisis surrounding nutrition is deep for me. I have spent too much time feeling unhealthy and uninspired given my dietary restrictions and want to help others who may be struggling with the same thing, which is why I created this website.</p>
<h2>My Diet Philosophy</h2>
<p>Well, besides feeling existential that is....<br>I believe in an individualistic approach to nutrition, so what works for me, may not be the best fit for you! And that's ok. Every body is different, and it's embracing these differences that can help clarify what could be the missing piece in your personal nutrition puzzle. I believe on focusing on unprocessed foods as much as possible, while still enjoying convenience when desired. One thing I enjoy about existentialism (and why it's so relevant to my personal philosophy) is that it conveys the importance of personal choice and responsilbilty. Ultimately, we choose how we live our lives, including our diets! But sometimes we need a little help, right?<br>With that, I'm happy to be a part of your journey in figuring out how best to achieve your health goals...for the health of it!</p>
